# Ailetics 💪🏻

## Introduction and Objectives 🎯
Our proposed project takes advantages of AI technology, including Python, Mediapipe, TensorFlow, and LSTM, o develop a personal trainer capable of detecting exercise form and ensures that it is correct. With a very high testing accuracy, our system enhances fitness routines by providing real-time feedback. This report explores our tools, results, and future expansion plans.

## Dataset Overview 📑

The dataset contains x,y coordinates of each point in the body as shown in the figure, and then, the LSTM model receives them and a label for which exercise it is. It does not need any cleaning and preprocessing.

## Model

The model is sequential from tensorflow, It consists of 3 LSTM layers with relu activation functions, then 2 Dense layers with relu also, and the output layer is a softmax with three classes. Here is the model summary.

As you can see in the video, the model was able to detect all of the exercises, the correct and incorrect. So we can say that its accuracy is 100% :)
